## Getting started

### Installation
To install this package, simply run
`npm i tough-name-generator`.

### Usage
There is only one function, called `get()`.
This will give you your tough name (just a string). All you have to do is add the package to your program by putting
`const tough = require("tough-name-generator")`.
Then you can call the function as `tough.get()` and use your freshly generated tough name as you like.
